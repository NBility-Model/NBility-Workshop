## Preparing your Github account to configure Archi integration

1. Log onto your GitHub Account at [GitHub.com](github.com) or create a GitHub account at [GitHub.com](github.com)
2. **Only for the EDSNS workshop**: Share your GitHub Account name with workshop facilitors (Jonas & Prince) via email. 
3. To configure Archi for Github integration you would need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your user account.  For a detailed overview of the process you can visit https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below:

### Create a Github Personal Access Token (PAT)

7. Click [**Generate token**]
8. Copy the token from the screen and store it securely for configuration purposes.  **IMPORTANT**: YOU CANNOT RETRIEVE THE TOKEN AFTER IT HAS BEEN GENERATED AND DISPLAYED ON THIS PAGE.  IF YOU LOOSE IT YOU WILL NEED TO GENERATE A NEW TOKEN.
