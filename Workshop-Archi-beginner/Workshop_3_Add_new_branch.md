## Add new branch

To protect the integrity of the main branch and avoid overwriting updates from someone else, it is recommended to create a branch for each new piece of work.  Branches could be named by feature_[**topic name**] or fix_[**topic name**].  Branches can be created either through the coArchi plugin or via Github.com.

### Via the coArchi plugin

1. In Archi, select [**Toggle Branches View**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

2. In Branches Workspace, click on the [**Add branch**] icon.

3. [**Add branch**] will create a local branch while [**Add branch and checkout**] will create the local branch and set it as the active branch.  Neither of these actions will create the upstream branch (on Github server).

4. To commit and publish the new branch, following the steps from [**Commiting changes**] and [**Publishing Changes**].
