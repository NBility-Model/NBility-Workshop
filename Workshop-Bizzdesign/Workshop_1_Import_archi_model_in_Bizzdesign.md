## Import archi model in Bizzdesign
This is a step by step guide to import a .xml file in Bizzdesign Enterprise Studio. By following this guide you will be able to import architecture elements, element properties and relationships between elements contained in the .xml file. A pre-requisite to this guide, is that you already have generated an .xml file from an architecture modeling tool like Archi (see guide Workshop 7 Export model to XML file). 

1.	Open Bizzdesign. On the landing page you will see the option to go to the modeler, click on Enterprise Studio Online.

11.	From the pop menu navigate to the Home Folder where you saved the .xml file to be imported in Step. Select the file and press OK.
