## Committing changes

By committing changes you create a local snapshot of the repository into a single package.  **This does not upload the changes to the upstream branch, but create a local packaged copy**.  To commit your latest changes, select [**Commit changes**] from the Collaboration menu.

## Publishing changes

The final step is to publish the committed package back to the repository.  This will insert the last committed package into the upstream branch.
