## Add new branch

To protect the integrity of the main branch and avoid overwriting updates from oneanother, it is recommended to create a branch for each new piece of work.  Branches could be named by initials, date or subdomain.  Branches can be created either through the coArchi plugin or online on Github.

![coArchi-add-branch]()

[**Add branch**] will create a local branch while [**Add branch and checkout**] will create the local branch and set it as the active branch.  Neither of these actions will create the upstream branch (on Github server).

![coArchi-switch-branch]()
