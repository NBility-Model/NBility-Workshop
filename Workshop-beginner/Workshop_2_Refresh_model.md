## Refresh model

**It is important to refresh the model from Github prior to making any changes to avoid overwriting upstream changes made since the local repo copy was pulled from the server**.  Regular refreshes also help to keep local repo copies updated with changes made to the upstream repository. 

1. To refresh your local copy of the model, open the model / branch from the Collaboration Workspace and select [**Refresh Model**] from the **Collaboration** application menu.

Alternatively, you can - in archi - select [**Toggle Collaboration Workspace**] from the **Collaboration** application menu and refresh Model there.
